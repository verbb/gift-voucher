# Voucher Codes

### Overview

Voucher codes are unique codes generated automatically after the purchase of a voucher. You can add these manually through the control panel at any time, with the code generating automatically for you.

The overview provides a list of all codes and their details listed below:

- **Code** - The generated voucher code that is used when redeeming the voucher.
- **Voucher** - A link to the associated voucher product the code is generated for.
- **Voucher Type** - A link to the associated voucher type the code is generated for.
- **Order** - If the voucher was purchased and not generated manually, this will show a link to the order where the voucher was purchased.
- **Amount** - The amount of discount the code provides. If the code was redeemed partially it shows the remaining amount on the voucher.
- **Expiry Date** - If set, the expiry date shows the date when the voucher expires. The voucher code can still be used on the same date of expiry.
- **Redeemed** - Shows if the code is already redeemed.
- **Delete** - Manually added codes can be deleted. This option is not available for codes generated from a customer purchase.

### Edit

In the case that a voucher code has expired and was not used, you can change the **Expiry Date** to make it valid again. You can also adjust the **Amount** or set **Redeemed** back to no.

If the code was added manually, you have to select an associated **Voucher** for it. This option is not available if the code was generated through a customer purchase.
